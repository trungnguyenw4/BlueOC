*most_frequent_string_lengths

lengths = [len(s) for s in strings]: This list comprehension calculates the length of each string in the input list.

length_counts = Counter(lengths): This creates a frequency dictionary (using Counter) that maps each string length to its occurrence count.

max_frequency = max(length_counts.values()): This finds the maximum frequency of any string length.

most_frequent_lengths = [length for length, count in length_counts.items() if count == max_frequency]: This list comprehension identifies all lengths that have the maximum frequency.

result = [s for s in strings if len(s) in most_frequent_lengths]: This filters the original list to include only strings with the most frequent lengths.

*Unit Test Function
TestMostFrequentStringLengths is a test class that contains test methods for different cases.

Each test method uses self.assertEqual to compare the function's output to the expected output.

Running the test will validate that the function works as expected.
