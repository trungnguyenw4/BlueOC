*sum_of_two_largest
Handling Edge Case: The function raises a ValueError if the input array contains fewer than two elements.

Finding Two Largest Integers:
The first max(nums) finds the largest integer in the list.
nums.remove(first_max) removes the largest integer, so it isnâ€™t considered in the second max(nums).
The second max(nums) finds the next largest integer.

Returning the Sum: The function returns the sum of these two integers.

*TestSumOfTwoLargest(unittest.TestCase):
TestSumOfTwoLargest is a test class containing test cases.

Each test method uses self.assertEqual to compare the function's output to the expected output.

Edge Case Handling: The test_case_6 checks if the function correctly raises a ValueError when the input list has fewer than two elements.

Test Case Analysis:
[1, 4, 2, 3, 5]: The two largest integers are 5 and 4, so the sum is 9.

[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]: The two largest integers are 50 and 40, so the sum is 90.

[-10, -20, -30, -40, -50]: The two largest integers are -10 and -20, so the sum is -30.

[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]: The two largest integers are both 1, so the sum is 2.

[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]: The two largest integers are 1 and 0, so the sum is 1.
